         <p class="row-paragraph">Interact System:<br>

          In the game you go around collecting orbs, there needed to be a solid interact system that required you to hold down a button for a certain duration to interact with said object. This also needed to update all other clients in the game.<br><br>
          
          This required refactoring, and gave me a good understanding of what a good interact system could look like in Unreal.<br><br>

       <div class="row-container">
         <p class="row-paragraph">Orbs:<br>

          When an orb is collected in Soul Maze the orb UI needed to be updated for all players in the game, as previously mentioned. With my understanding of the Unreal class heirachy, and their relationships in multiplayer, I quickly knew a solution. Utilizing the player controller and the game state class I could update each player about the change in the amount of orbs collected and alter the current game state for each player.<br><br>
          
          This refined my knowledge of Unreal's class hierachy, and the relationships when it comes to multiplayer.<br><br>

         <p class="row-paragraph">AI Senses:<br>

          The AI sense system had issues, it was detecting players through walls in the maze and did not ultilize the hearing sense. With the help of a line trace, I could determine whether an AI should see a player or not. Finally, without hearing the AI seemed unresponsive, with the addition of hearing the AI could investigate a location where the player made noise.<br><br>
          
          With my knowledge of games such as Last of Us, how they deal with AI detection is similar, utilizing a line trace from the head of the AI to the body of the player to confirm if the player should be detected or not, I was able to resolve this issue and this cemented that knowledge.<br><br>

       <div class="row-container">
         <p class="row-paragraph">Death/ Ghost:<br>

          The designer wanted a death system identical to that of Phasmophobia. In Phasmophobia when the player dies they themselves turn into ghosts, and this is the Phasmophobia's way of allowing the clients to spectate. I helped with the multiplayer aspect of allowing the players to walk around invisible to the alive players, allowing the players to be ignored by the AI and prevent them from interacting or be accounted for in terms of the end game conditions.<br><br>
          
          It is always interesting when recreating a mechanic from another game. It is bittersweet when playing a game as a developer, because you're probably find yourself thinking about how something is made rather than enjoying the game. But, I find this line of thinking very helpful if i ever create a mechanic similar to that of a game i've played.<br><br>

          I came to help out with some of the issues with soul maze in my spare time whilst working on Loch Ness fulltime. Our level designer decided to work on Soul Maze in his free time and asked if I could help him with some of the bugs. A lot of the issues were surrounding multiplayer, things I have previously had a lot of experience with when developing Loch Ness.<br><br>
          
          The biggest challenge was getting to grips with a project I had no part in, well into development. But, this allowed my to further my debugging skills and my ability to understand what code is doing quickly. So, with quick debugging skills, and an intuition for how a bug has occured, I can resolve the issue fast.<br><br>
